0. Game Design: what we need?
   - screen 
   - pictures of castle, shooter(player),badguy
1. Basic
   - while loop (why refresh screen each time in while loop)
   - for loop
   - library: pygame, pygame.locals(https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/locals.html)
2. Draw more characters
   - for loop: range - try to change range(width//grass.get_width()+1) to (width//grass.get_width())
3. Make player move by keys W,S,A,D
   - https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/key.html
   - +=1,-=
4. Rotate player by mouse position 
   - library: math
5. Add arrows and make them move(shooting)
   - list: append, pop
6. Add badguys
   - list again
   - when badguy attack castle
   - random
7. Arrows vs. Badguys
   - Rectangle collision check method
   - operator: /,//,%
8. Healthbar and Clock
   - https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/font.html -> render()
9. Win or Lose
   - How to decide? Time/HealthValue
   - while condition changed to 'running' check
10.Sound Effects
   - pygame.mixer.Sound() (https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/mixer.html)
